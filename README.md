This demo RabbitMQ project runs a simple example of a producer sending a message that
is consumed by a consumer.

In order to run this, you need to have Node.js and RabbitMQ installed on your machine.

Create an `.env` file in the root directory of the project. It must values for:
```
# RabbitMQ
MQ_HOSTNAME=<hostname>
MQ_PORT=<port>
```
